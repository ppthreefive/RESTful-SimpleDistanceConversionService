# RESTful-SimpleDistanceConversionService
This service was purely created to test a creation of a RESTful web service. The base functionality includes distance conversion (Miles to Kilometers, and vice versa).

At the time of creating this repository, the base URI's in the TryIt.aspx.cs code are legitimate and webhosted versions of the service.svc.
